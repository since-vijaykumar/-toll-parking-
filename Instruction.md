# How to Setup Toll Parking project
- Install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers version 'Eclipse IDE 2019â€‘12' from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
- Once install , start eclipse -> provide eclipse workspace

 Once eclipse is installed we need to clone toll Parking project to eclipse so that we can use it for development.
 - Copy git repo URI from https://github.com/since-vijaykumar/toll-parking, it will look like` https://github.com/since-vijaykumar/toll-parking.git`
 - Open Eclipse -> File -> Import -> Git -> Project from Git -> Clone URI
 - Paste copied URI and click next-> provide location -> next -> finish

All good to go for development.
